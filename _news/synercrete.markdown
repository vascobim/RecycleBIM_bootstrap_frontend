Some WP2 elements participated in the #SynerCrete'23 - International RILEM Conference on Synergising Expertise towards Sustainability and Robustness of Cement-based Materials and Concrete Structures, which took place on Milos Island, Greece, from 14-16 June 2023. They presented the paper titled 'RecycleBIM Approach Towards Integrated Data Management for Circularity: Proof of Concept in a RC Building,' which was developed by the team. The objective was to communicate and disseminate key information produced in the RecycleBIM project. Nevertheless, Prof. Miguel Azenha, Coordinator of UMinho team, carried out a key role as part of the Organizing Committee and Chair of the Scientific Committee.
