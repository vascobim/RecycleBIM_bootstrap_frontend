On October 11, 2023, a team member from the RecycleBIM project had the privilege of taking part in the 5th International Conference on the Progress of Recycling in the Built Environment. During the event, they presented a paper titled 'RecycleBIM: A Framework for Enhancing the Circularity of Construction Materials through Modeling,' a collaborative effort involving all the project's Work Packages.

This event provided an excellent platform to promote the project and engage in the exchange of innovative ideas with fellow researchers and projects in the same field.
