On December 13th, in Guimar√£es, Campus de Couros, an inspiring collaboration unfolded between RecycleBIM Project members from the Universidade do Minho and the Universidade de Vigo!

During our meeting, we delved into the intricate details of Scan-to-BIM workflows within the project and exchanged insights on the latest developments. It was a fantastic opportunity to strengthen our bonds and align our visions for the future collaboration.

Grateful for the chance to connect with our incredible partners from UVigo, we are enthusiastic about the strides we've made and eagerly anticipate the next steps in the project. Together, we are shaping the digitalized future and sustainable practices!
