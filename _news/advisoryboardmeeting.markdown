The RecycleBIM Consortium held an online Workshop with its Advisory Board on 17th May to discuss the current progress of the project. In this extremely productive meeting, the presentations on each WP by its corresponding WP leader was met with very positive feedback and pertinent suggestions/comments for the further development of each task. 

The meeting was focused on the following aspects:
-	Introduction of the Consortium and Advisory Board Members;
-	News and updates about the general issues of the Project
-	Managing and Coordination points
-	Presentation of the work developed by each WP
-	Advisory Board commentary and discussion on each WP and on the progress of the project overall

The RecycleBIM Consortium fully appreciates the time, dedication, and expertise of our Advisory Board!
