The kick-off meeting of the RecycleBIM project took place this Monday, 05/02/22, through an online session with the Consortium Members, and was focused on the following aspects:

- Introduction of the Consortium Members;
- Updates of the beneficiary partners on the local kick-start;
- Deliberation towards the data sharing solution to be used;
- Deliberation towards the communication strategy to be implemented;
- Evaluation of the initial milestones, deliverables and tasks, with special attention to the deliverables up the twelfth month of the project;
- Scheduling of the 1st presential meeting.
- 
Regarding the data sharing and communication solution, the choice was to use USBIM, which is a BIM management system developed by ACCA, that allows the storage of documents and collaboration between users in a project. 

In addition, it was informed that the consortium was completely signed, allowing ACCA to deploy project initiation.
