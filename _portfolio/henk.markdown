content: Henk Jonkers research focusses on the development of bio-adapted building 
materials. These are materials that contain, or stimulate growth of, living 
organisms resulting in increased functional performance and decreased 
environmental impact. Examples are bacteria-based self-healing concrete and 
moss-receptive concrete. Further research focus is on implementation of nature 
in the built environment with the aim to increase wellbeing of humans, quality of 
nature, and climate resistance of built structures. Development of circular building 
methods and strategies aiming to decrease use of finite raw materials and 
emission of harmful substances as well as biodegradation mechanisms of 
building materials are also part of the research portfolio.
